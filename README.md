# Caribbean_Acropora_Transcriptomes

This repository includes the transcriptomes of the two Acropora species found in the Caribbean, Acropora palmata and A. cervicornis, and that of their F1 hybrid A. prolifera. Within each subdirectory can be found the completed transcriptome along with annotation files and a .txt file of methods used for each transcriptome's assembly, symbiont and contamination filtering, and annotation. 

Assembly, filtering, and annotation was done using the pipelines developed by Adam Freedman (https://github.com/adamfreedman), Carly Kenkel (https://github.com/ckenkel), and Misha Matz (https://github.com/z0on).

These transcriptomes are part of a larger study on hybrid coral thermal tolerance and gene expression patterns underpining heterotic phenotypes in A. prolifera. Raw sequence files associated with the generation of the transcriptomes can be found under accession https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/, PRJNA1015285.
